### Solution notes

I began testing EVERY number from 2520 onward for mutltiples, until it was running for a while, and only at 2 million or so and i realized this would TAKE forever. Than i thought about the problem a little bit more. 2520 is the LCM for 1-10. That isn't arbitrary. In order for a number to be divisible by 1-20, it needs to be divisible by 1-10. The product of 2520 and anything will be divisible by 1-10, so now we can start testing way less numbers....BAM!
